# Algorithmic-Study Leetcode Solutions Repository
This is a repository where I write out some of the leetcode problems I complete. I do this because it helps me strengthen the concepts in my mind and creates a great resource for me to come back to refresh on these topics. Since this is public, I hope that it can help others as well.

I try to write the descriptions in a no-nonsense, beginner-friendly way, so if you arent quite getting the approach or intuition behind a certain problem, feel free to read my explanation. All explanations also include fully commented code, a discussion on the time complexity, and an in depth explanation on how to solve the problem. 

Let me know if there is an issue or error in any of the explanations.

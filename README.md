# Algorithmic-Study Leetcode Solutions Repository
This is a repository where I write out some of the leetcode problems I complete. I do this because it helps me strengthen the concepts in my mind and creates a great resource for me to come back to refresh on these topics. Since this is public, I hope that it can help others as well.

I personally find the Leetcode Editorials to be overly complicated, and they teach a lot of irrelevant, over-the-top, and unecessary stuff. Not every problem even has an editorial either, so a repository like this 
makes more sense to have.

Rather than jumbling the problems into one long list of files, I have sorted them into folders based on the primary data structure or algorithm used. Feel free to navigate through the directories to find any specific problem or topic.

I try to write the descriptions in a no-nonsense, beginner-friendly way, so if you arent quite getting the approach or intuition behind a certain problem, feel free to read my explanatioms. All explanations also include fully commented code, a discussion on the time complexity, and an in depth explanation on how to solve the problem. Of course for more complex problems it will still be difficult to understand my explanation, such is the nature of those problems (typically LC Hards).

Let me know if there is an issue or error in any of the explanations.
